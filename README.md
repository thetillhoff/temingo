# temingo

This software aims to provide a simple but powerful templating mechanism.

The original idea was to create a simple static site generator, which is not as overloaded with unnecessary" functionality" as f.e. hugo.
The result, though, is not bound to website stuff, it can be used for any textfile-templating.
